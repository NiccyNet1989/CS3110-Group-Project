================================================================================
Nicholas Magtangob - NiccyNet1989
  - Created Github
  - Created Initial NFA for Decimal Reader
  - Created NFA to Java Tools
	-Includes 3 classes ; NFA, State, and Transition
		- Main Driver (Creates Transitions, States, and NFA Object)
		- NFA Class (Includes major function for running input string through an NFA object)
		- State Class (Includes functionality for transitions
		- Transition Class (Contains fields for input and state to transition to)
		-Basic framework allows for the easy construction of an NFA in Java
		-Framework used for all other parts of the project, including reading in Decimal, Octal, Hex, Floating Point, and combining all 4
  - Completed Java Program for Part 1 of Project
	-Constructed NFA in JFlap
	-Created NFA jpg Image
	-Read NFA into Java program (NFA for part 1 is now represented through Java Code)
  - Completed Java Program for Extra Credit of Project
	- Developed NFA on JFlap which recognizes Python Floating Point Literals
	- Saved and added JFlap NFA and jpg image into repository
	- Utilized the "NFA to Java" tools we created earlier to represent the created NFA in JFlap in a Java Program
  - Edited Main files to allow user to input test strings through console (After the program has already run test strings from "in_ans")
  


Jayden Nguyen - Jayvnn
  - Assisted in debugging file paths and input/output issues in the Java program  
  - Modified the main.java to correctly load the NFA from JFLAP and read test cases from in_ans.txt  
  - Integrated file-based testing to generate out.txt with actual, expected results and pass/fail status  
  - Contributed to refining error handling and console debugging outputs  
  - Added error handling
  - Implementing addition code documention in Main.java
